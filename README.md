# Hi I 
hope this message finds you in great spirits.

Please read instructions carefully. 
Pretty please...Life becomes super easy when your brain is calm so in order to calm your brain 
consider doing the following before proceeding with this folder:
                                 - 1 Drink some water (preferably with some lemon or cucumber)
                                 - 2 Breathe in and out (Try to do so 4 times)
                                 - Go outside and if you can't try to <i class="fa fa-window-open" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                                 - Read like the rent is due tomorrow at 5am
git clone https://github.com/paradoxmelody/foodgoapp.git

Everytime you make a change in your code and save it
make sure to write the following in the terminal: 
git add .
git commit -m "Issa parade inside my city yeah" -- you can replace the "issa parade inside my city yeah with anything that sets ya soul on fire"
git push

 

#FOR THE BACKEND -- SPECIAL ATTENTION
cd server  
npm install --- very very important --- you can't run this unless you have node installed
so head to nodejs.org to learn more and download -- womp womp  
after running npm install 
run: npm run dev  

#FRONTEND <i class="fas fa-people-carry    "></i>
cd client  
npm install  
npm start 

seriously this is a lifesaver 
Reading can save your life-- trust me  
Learn to give yourself grace and by doing so you will in turn learn to give grace to others -- self-compassion dude
what doth this mean? Being egotistical will only be detrimental for the team -- so if you do not understand
something don't go and make a mess, instead try to ask. It won't hurt you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

You are capable and I belive in you plus I love you and you so cuteüòó
